# English [Dis]claimer

Dear all,

this blog is an interactive and discussible version of my Russian red-pill 'men's rights' (MRA/MRM) book.

Literally the title means 'Beware of the Family', but I prefer translating it as 'F***ing With Your Life - On Birds and Bees for Ripened'.
It contains info on legal, psychological and philosophical aspects on the whole modern family institution in Russia, as well as an introduction into Western MRA theme for Russian readers.

The content is strictly positioned as 'private opinion' only and is subject to change.
It's highly unlikely that it will ever be translated into English, but some topics are to be discussed in English in [my bilingual Youtube channel](http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiM_AyzjGAToMCMkWAauZVg). One may get a bit of a grip on the meaning of the text through [Google translate](http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&sl=ru&tl=en&prev=_dd&u=http%3A%2F%2Fjcjgbnlbd.blogspot.com%2F) though.

Regards.
